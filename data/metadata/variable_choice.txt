- Macroeconomic targets are taken from OECD to ensure internationally harmonized definitions, while predictors are drawn primarily from FRED to construct a rich real-time information set including financial, labor market, and leading indicators.

✅ Targets (OECD)
	•	OECD CPI inflation
	•	OECD unemployment rate
	•	OECD real GDP growth

✅ Predictors (FRED)

Real activity
	•	Industrial Production (INDPRO)
	•	Retail sales
	•	Capacity utilization

Labor leading indicators
	•	Initial jobless claims
	•	Avg weekly hours

Monetary & financial
	•	Fed Funds rate
	•	Yield curve spreads
	•	Credit spreads
	•	Financial Conditions Index

Expectations
	•	Consumer sentiment
	•	Inflation expectations

-> Split:
	•	OECD = what we forecast
	•	FRED = information set available to forecasters
     -> avoid mixing OECD targets with FRED predictors due to measurement leakage or conceptual redundancy
