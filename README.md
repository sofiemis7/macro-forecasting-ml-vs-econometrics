# Forecasting Macroeconomic Indicators  
**Comparing Classical Econometrics and Machine Learning Approaches**

---

## Project Overview

This project investigates the forecasting of key macroeconomic indicators—namely inflation (CPI), unemployment, and GDP growth—using both classical time series models and modern machine learning techniques. The goal is to assess predictive performance, interpretability, and policy relevance across methods.

Forecasting economic indicators is critical for central banks, policy planners, and asset managers. This project bridges the gap between transparent statistical modeling and high-performance machine learning pipelines.

## Objectives

- Forecast macroeconomic indicators using real-world time series data
- Compare performance between classical econometric models and machine learning techniques
- Highlight trade-offs in accuracy, interpretability, and policy implications
- Provide a modular, extensible framework for future experimentation

---

## Target Indicators

- **Consumer Price Index (CPI)** – as a measure of inflation
- **Unemployment Rate**
- **Real GDP Growth**

All data are quarterly and span from **Q1 2000 to Q2 2025**.
